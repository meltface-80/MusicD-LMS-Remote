# CLAUDE.md — working rules for this repo

MusicD LMS Remote: a music-discovery PWA + wall display for Lyrion Music
Server (LMS). Node/Express backend (`index.js`) talks to LMS over JSON-RPC
(`lib/lms.js`); the frontend is a no-build vanilla PWA (`public/`). See the
Layout section of README.md.

## Process — applies to every task

1. **Use agent workers for all tasks.** Fan out background subagents to
   research/map the codebase (and the web, where sources need verifying)
   before implementing. Implement in the main session on their findings —
   don't have multiple agents edit the same files.

2. **Verify before committing.** `npm test` must pass. For anything touching
   the server or frontend behaviour, run an end-to-end check against a fake
   LMS JSON-RPC server (spawn `index.js` with `LMS_HOST`/`LMS_PORT` pointed
   at a mock; drive the UI with Playwright — Chromium is at
   `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`). Never leave a `data/` directory behind in
   the repo (it's gitignored, but clean up after test runs).

3. **Bump the version once a new build is ready.** When a feature set /
   fix set is complete and verified, bump `version` in `package.json` and
   commit it as `Release v1.0.x` with short release notes in the commit
   body. **Keep v1.0.x numbering for now** — the owner will advise
   explicitly when to move to v1.1.x or beyond.

4. **The version bump IS the release.** This repo has no tags or GitHub
   releases; the in-app updater resolves the latest version from
   `package.json` on `main` and downloads the `main` tarball. Merging the
   bump publishes the update to every install.

5. **Keep the GitHub Pages site in step with every release.** The docs /
   configurator page (`docs/index.html`, served at
   https://meltface-80.github.io/MusicD-LMS-Remote/) shows the current
   version and must be updated in the same release commit: bump the
   `#version-badge` fallback text to match `package.json` (the badge also
   self-updates from `package.json` on `main` via fetch, but the static
   fallback must not drift), and reflect any new user-facing features or
   changed setup/config steps in the page's content.

## Git

- Develop on the designated `claude/…` branch; after a PR merges, restart
  the same branch from `origin/main` (`git checkout -B <branch>
  origin/main`) — never stack onto merged history.
- Don't create PRs unless asked; the owner merges.

## Gotchas worth remembering

- Artist strings split into separate clickable artists on ALL of " / ",
  "; ", ", ", " & ", " + " and feat./featuring/ft. (owner decision, v1.0.5 —
  band names containing " & " split too, knowingly; each part's artist page
  still lists the band's albums). Keep `lib/search.js` MAIN/ANY_SPLIT_RE and
  `public/app.js` ARTIST_SPLIT_RE in step. Artist identity comparisons go
  through `search.artistKey()` (stylization-folded: P!nk == Pink), display
  strings never do.
- Pitchfork review TEXT must never reach a client (UK-law compliance):
  score / Best-New-Music flag / link only. Review text comes ONLY from the LMS
  Music & Artist Information (MAI) plugin (`lib/albuminfo.js`).
- Reviews / bios / artwork / artist photos come from the LMS MAI plugin
  (`musicartistinfo` albumreview/biography/albumcovers/artistphoto[s]); there is
  NO app-side Qobuz/Tidal streaming integration — those were removed (v1.0.15).
  Browsing/adding online-library albums is done on the SERVER via its own
  Qobuz/Tidal plugins; the app opens the LMS Material skin (`/material/`) in the
  embedded frame (topbar "Browse Qobuz" button → server-browse-toggle). The
  `lib/labels.js` Qobuz label lookup is an unrelated PUBLIC web scrape (no
  account/API) and stays.
- Song/album LMS tag letters differ (`c` vs `j` for cover ids; see
  `lib/lms.js` TRACK_TAGS/ALBUM_TAGS comments) — check the comments before
  adding tags.
- `/api/queue` returns only current + upcoming tracks; `queue_item_id` is
  the REAL LMS playlist index (play-from-here/remove depend on it).
- The music mount is READ-ONLY: never write artwork/metadata back to files or
  LMS. Owner album edits (`lib/albumedits.js`, `data/album-edits.json`) and
  rescued cover art (`lib/albumart.js`, `data/artwork/` + cache) live in the
  app's own DB, keyed by the ORIGINAL LMS title+artist so they survive
  rescans. Both are layered onto the LMS rows in `buildIndex` before
  `search.loadRecords`; a record carries `origTitle/origArtist/origYear/
  origImageKey` so "Remove edits" can restore LMS values. Rescued/edited
  covers use content-addressed `art-…` image keys served straight from disk by
  `/api/image` (a new cover mints a new key — immutable HTTP caching stays
  safe). Artwork sources, best-first: MAI `albumcovers` → Cover Art Archive by
  MBID (LMS tag M = release id) → MusicBrainz release-group search (artistKey
  fold, no disambiguation) → iTunes.
- Logging goes through the leveled logger `lib/log.js` (`makeLogger("tag")` →
  error/warn/info/debug/trace; `.child("sub")`, `.enabled(level)`). Level from
  env: `LOG_LEVEL` wins, else `DEBUG=1`→debug / `DEBUG=trace`→trace, else info.
  Prefer it over `console.*` in new code; pass a tagged `log:` into lib
  factories (lms/albumart/albuminfo already take one). Keep failure diagnostics
  at debug and per-request/per-command firehose at trace. COMPLIANCE: never log
  Pitchfork review TEXT — URL/score/status only. `setLogFile()` (called once in
  index.js) tees every line to a rotating file under `data/logs/` (8MB × 10
  archives, Roon-style); console output is unchanged so `docker logs` works.
- Transport polling is ADAPTIVE and must stay cheap: the phone app
  (`public/app.js` fetchState loop) and the wall (`public/display.js` pollLoop)
  poll `/api/zone-state` ~2s while playing, ~6s when paused/stopped (progress is
  interpolated client-side). `/api/zone-state` hits LMS live per call, so
  concurrent app+display polls are coalesced server-side (`playerStatusShared`).
  Don't reintroduce fixed fast polls.
- `public/app.js` is a series of sibling IIFEs (separate scopes, NOT one closure)
  — there is ONE shared HTML-escaper `esc()` at script top-level for all of them.
  Any LMS/network string put into `innerHTML` MUST go through `esc()` (album/
  artist/track names carry markup, esp. online-library titles the owner didn't
  author). Prefer `textContent`/DOM building where possible.
- Endpoints that fetch a USER-SUPPLIED URL server-side (album-edit `art_url`,
  label-logo `url`) must pass it through `assertPublicUrl()` (`lib/urlguard.js`)
  first — it rejects loopback/private/link-local/ULA targets (SSRF guard). It
  validates the request TARGET; an HTTP redirect to a private address is a known
  residual gap. Don't add new server-side fetches of caller URLs without it.
- Qobuz-catalogue search (albums NOT in the library) is driven through the LMS
  Qobuz plugin over JSON-RPC by MENU-ACTION REPLAY, the same mechanism Material
  uses — not by parsing Qobuz ids. `lib/lms.js` walks `qobuz items` (root →
  Search node, cached; descends into an Albums category if search returns
  sub-menus) and captures each album row's `play`/`add` menu actions
  (`menuAction()` merges response-level `base.actions` with per-item `params`);
  `qobuzRunAction()` replays them as `qobuz playlist play|add …`. Every `qobuz`
  dispatch is needs-client=1, so a real player id is required (search uses
  `state.players[0].id`). Actions are held SERVER-SIDE in `qobuzActionStore`
  keyed by an opaque token (30-min TTL) the client echoes to `/api/qobuz/play` —
  the client never submits a raw LMS command. This generalises to Tidal/Deezer
  (same interface, different tag). Result covers reuse the `url-…` image_key →
  `/api/image` → LMS imageproxy path. NOTE: the exact plugin menu shapes are
  unverified against a live server — keep it defensive and logged.
- Qobuz FAVOURITES (the heart) also use menu-action replay — the plugin has no
  favourite CLI verb, so `qobuzAlbumFavoriteToggle()` descends into an album's
  menu (its captured `go` action), finds the Add/Remove-favourite child and
  invokes it only when the state must change. Favouriting is FAVOURITE-ONLY (no
  library rescan, owner decision). Library albums expose `qobuz_id`
  (`search.qobuzIdFromExtid` off the `qobuz:album:<id>` extid); the client fills
  a heart on any tile whose id is in `/api/qobuz/favorites` (server-cached 60s
  via `qobuzFavoriteAlbums`, which walks the root Favorites node). Search-result
  hearts POST `/api/qobuz/favorite` (token → stored `go`); library-tile hearts
  POST `/api/qobuz/favorite-id` (qobuz_id → the favourites cache's `go`). Same
  live-server caveat — defensive + logged.
